<p>One of the reasons Twitter acquired Gnip was because Twitter believes the best way to support the distribution of Twitter data is to have direct data relationships with its data customers – the companies building analytic solutions using Twitter’s data and platform.Direct relationships help Twitter develop a deeper understanding of customer needs, get direct feedback for the product roadmap, and work more closely with data customers to enable the best possible solutions for the brands that rely on Twitter data to make better decisions.At Twitter’s Analyst Day last November, Twitter’s VP of Data Strategy noted that when Twitter acquired Gnip, Gnip had the clear majority of Twitter’s data reseller business – the rest was held by the other two data resellers, DataSift and NTT Data.The acquisition of Gnip was the first step toward developing more direct relationships with data customers.The next step in working directly with data customers is to transition everyone receiving raw data for commercial use from other data resellers to a direct relationship with Twitter.</p>
