<p>THE expression “at the touch of a button” connotes speed and immediacy.Amazon is taking the phrase literally.This week the e-commerce firm announced a programme that offers members of its Prime scheme branded, wireless-connected buttons, which they can place around their home and press when they are running low on certain household items.Doing so initiates an order to replenish whatever is needed, from detergent to bottled water, and the order is shipped to the customer’s home.Is the habit of sitting down at a computer to shop online becoming passé?</p>
