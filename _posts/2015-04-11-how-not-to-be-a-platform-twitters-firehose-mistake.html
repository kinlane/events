<p>We’re huge fans of Twitter – both as users and observers of the impact the Twitter API.Since it was opened, Twitter’s API has shown how providing access can unleash huge waves of innovation – giving rise to clients, data businesses and much more.So it’s very sad to see the news today that the company will be cutting off their firehose partners.This will directly affect third party data re-sellers (DataSift already responded) and end customers.However, it is likely to affect not only them, but also be very negative to Twitter in the long run.</p>
