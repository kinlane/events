Ive been monitoring an emerging slice of the API, that has been dubbed microservices for some time now, and youve even heard me explore its use, when describing my architectural approach to redesigning more core API stack for my internal systems.I’m slowly redesigning my internal API stack, keeping them as small as possible, throughout all aspects of operations, deploying each endpoint in a single dockerized container, that contains the OS, database, web server and all server side API code.Im also using Github, in conjunction with APIs.json to assist me in my orchestration, throughout every aspect of these APIs lifecycle from design to testing—all a new approach for me when managing my APIs.Is defining my APIs in this way, so that the definition is much more than just the actual API endpoints, but also include the entire backend, and lifecycle workflow Microservices?</p>
