Yay!Another story generated by listening to Traffic and Weather (blame John and Steve).I do enjoy sharing my random thoughts while listening to those two.This one is around the SDK discussion during the latest episode, but as they noted, they’ve talked about SDKs a lot in the past.This particular reference was again, during the their discussion about Microsoft using Swagger to generate code—a topic which brought up the usual grumbles from John about SDKs.</p>
