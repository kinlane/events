<p>A note to my fellow real estate technology vendors:
At the highest level, we (the tech providers) are focused on delivering best-in-class technology and ensuring that our clients have a great experience with our products.However, the concept of “a great experience” has vastly evolved over the past few years, and companies with painful legacy systems simply won’t survive.After the big search portals digitized our industry, agents were shaken.We saw consumers, for the first time, searching for their own home information rather than relying on the expertise of a real estate agent.The outcome: a new way of doing business that was anchored around these portals because there was no efficient alternative.</p>
