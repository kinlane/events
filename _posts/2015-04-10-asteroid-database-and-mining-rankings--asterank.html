<p>Asterank is a scientific and economic database of over 600,000 asteroids.Weve collected, computed, or inferred important data such as asteroid     mass and composition from multiple scientific sources.With this information,     we estimate the costs and rewards of mining asteroids.Details on orbits and basic physical parameters are sourced from the Minor     Planet Center and NASA JPL.Composition data is based on spectral     classification and size.</p>
